# Range Query data structures
This repository contains commonly used data structures for `range query - point update` and `range query - range update`

## Algorithms Included

### **1. Segment Tree**: 
A very commonly used data structure which supports range query and point update very efficiently.

### **2. Lazy Segment Tree**: 
Improved version of `Segment Tree` which supports range query and range update.

### **3. Fenwick Tree**: 
Similar to Segment Tree. It takes very less space than a traditional segment tree thus useful very memory is a bottleneck.


## To be Included soon
### **1. Sparse Table**:
Another Data structure for range query only. A typical usecase of this does not support any updates.
We precompute all the necessary details in this table to later answer our queries in constant time complexity.
